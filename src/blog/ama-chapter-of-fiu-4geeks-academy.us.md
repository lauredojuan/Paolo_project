# AMA Chapter of FIU + 4Geeks Academy - Getting Students Closer To A Coding Education




**_Miami, FL – Nov. 12, 2015 – _**4Geeks Academy and the FIU chapter of the American Marketing Association (AMA) started a collaboration this week to bring students closer to a coding education.  It all started with an Intro to Coding workshop held Monday, Nov. 9th and it will extend into another workshop at Florida International University, MMC Campus during the AMA’s Regional Conference.

Bringing startups and students together under one roof for networking, education, and job opportunities is the goal of the AMA’s Regional Conference, occurring Friday, Nov 13th.  4Geeks Academy, a startup dedicated to spreading the importance of knowing how to code and helping students acquire program developer’s jobs, will take main stage at the conference both serving as a speaker and executing a workshop to teach students the basics of coding.

“In order to become better marketers we should consider not only to talk to our customers but to our computers too, and that talking is through coding,” said Sherezade Rodriguez, general manager and conference speaker for 4Geeks Academy.

4Geeks Academy offers eleven weeks of full time programming and coding workshops in which students learn how to develop both the front-end and back-end sides of a website.  At the end of the eleven weeks, students are fully experienced and prepared to join the workforce.

The collaboration was specifically designed to reach students with an interest in the growing tech industry and stressing the importance of code in jobs just like marketing. Making the link stronger between students and the startup community is the foremost objective of the conference which is accomplished thanks to businesses like 4Geeks Academy sharing insights and experiences with students. It is the perfect place for a startup and a student to be on Friday, Nov 13th.
